This application is to be flashed onto the nRF52810 SoC and used with the Lura Health client application. This application utilizes the Nordic UART Service and advertises itself as "Lura  Health". 

This application was built upon the nRF5_SDK_15.2.0 UART example. To build and run, place all files into SDK_ROOT/examples/ble_peripheral/_folder_name_, where _folder_name_ is the folder containing all files within this repository. 

This application is currently under development and is not fully functional.
